You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-query-builder
```

The package will automatically register its service provider.

You can optionally publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\QueryBuilder\QueryBuilderServiceProvider" --tag="query-builder-config"
```

These are the contents of the default config file that will be published:

```php
return [

    /*
     * By default the package will use the `include`, `filter`, `sort`
     * and `fields` query parameters as described in the readme.
     *
     * You can customize these query string parameters here.
     */
    'parameters' => [
        'include' => 'include',

        'filter' => 'filter',

        'sort' => 'sort',

        'fields' => 'fields',

        'append' => 'append',
    ],

    /*
     * Related model counts are included using the relationship name suffixed with this string.
     * For example: GET /users?include=postsCount
     */
    'count_suffix' => 'Count',

    /*
     * Related model exists are included using the relationship name suffixed with this string.
     * For example: GET /users?include=postsExists
     */
    'exists_suffix' => 'Exists',
    
    /*
     * By default the package will throw an `InvalidFilterQuery` exception when a filter in the
     * URL is not allowed in the `allowedFilters()` method.
     */
    'disable_invalid_filter_query_exception' => false,

    /*
     * By default the package inspects query string of request using $request->query().
     * You can change this behavior to inspect the request body using $request->input()
     * by setting this value to `body`.
     *
     * Possible values: `query_string`, `body`
     */
    'request_data_source' => 'query_string',
];
```
